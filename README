For details on the Mongo Ruby Driver:

    http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/tree/master


To install the gems:
    
    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

= Design Documents

The table display columns and sort order of a collection can be defined using a Design Document.

A design document has an id of "_design", an optional list of columns and an optional sort order.

Sort order is based on the standard MongoDB sort options (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sorting)


=== Sample

    {
      "_id":"_design",
      "columns":["first_name","last_name"],
      "sort":{"last_name":1}
    }
